Today is my fortieth birthday. When my wife asked me today what I wanted to do, I replied "I'd like to work on my motorcycle." This motorcycle is both a thorn in her side and a bit of a joke. I've lugged this beast around from house to house over the years and never had a place to work on it. But the thing is that I really enjoy working with hands and making things...

Living in the city can make this type of unremarkable activity challenging: I don't have a garage (the bike was actually towed once as a derelict vehicle when I worked on it in the street), the bike is stored where my tools aren't, and it's not a simple task to coordinate everyone's schedule to allow me to work on it elsewhere.

The same is true of raising kids in a city. We can't open our front door and allow the kids to run free and explore on their own. That's not to say that our neighborhood isn't safe or that we're overprotective parents. It's just that some dangers (like traffic) are more imminent in a densely populated area and we must be cognizant of these things. The same could be said of living in the woods and checking for ticks every time you come in from playing.

I've been thinking about ways to incorporate my love of making and the different way of living that comes with a city. I'm starting on some projects that will hopefully take advantage of our location and influence our kids to become makers, too.

I've never been a big writer outside of work. All of my kids are avid readers but none of them write much away from school. I hope that some of this writing will encourage my kids to document what they're thinking, doing, and what inspires them.

A few quick notes on personnel and tools:

#### I'm your host, David

I'm a technologist by trade, but I don't specialize in anything in particular. I'm not "classical" trained and I am certainly not a programmer or software engineer. My dad put himself through college as a car mechanic, so I have a bit of an advantage over those without direct exposure to those kinds of things. I love all things marine, especially knots.

#### We're a family of five

My wife and I have three kids. At the time of this writing, my son is 11, daughter number one is 9, and daughter number two is 4.

#### All of this is public - please contribute!

You can clone the repository, make pull requests, open issues/comments, and anything else that a GitHub git repository supports. One of the things that I hope to instill in my kids is that sharing knowledge makes all of us richer and that everything in life should be version controlled.
